# Warning - Alpha

This is a Alpha setup of Arch linux used by me.

The setup is working perfectly smoothly fine with wayland and river window manager.
This repo is to keep track of all the binaries i make to config my setup.

Soon the whole setup with the Documentation will be there.

Till then this could be taken as reference.
